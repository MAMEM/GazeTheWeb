- New DOM node types (inclusive abstract superclass)

Furthermore:

Additional ideas:
- Emulate each keyboard key pressed on keyboard and show text, already filled in input field, and show temporary search results etc. as they appear
- Button for form submit? Emulating 'Enter' doesn't always submit a form
	-> Advanced form handling? e.g. check if all required fields are filled
