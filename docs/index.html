    <h2>What is GazeTheWeb?</h2>
    <p>
      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
      Information access and communication are among the main challenges that people aﬀected by severe
      disabilities have to face. World Wide Web provides a large amount of information to people, and it helps them to
      connect and communicate with society. In this regard, the <i>World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Accessibility
        Initiative</i>
      (WAI) states: “<i>Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and
        interact with the Web, and that they can contribute to the Web</i>”. However, these operations on Web interfaces
      are
      usually performed through conventional browser applications, controlled by input devices such as mouse or
      keyboard. In this regard, eye gaze
      interaction provides a novel tool to build hands-free Web interfaces, and to increase Web accessibility for
      cases where motor impairments hinder easy hand and body motion. Most graphical user interfaces (e.g., browsers)
      for Web access are not designed for use with eye tracking devices, which often have limited accuracy or may
      require unconventional selection techniques that interfere with access to information. Different interaction
      techniques like reading, scrolling, and clicking have been studied for precise eye-based access. However a
      major challenge to imply these interactions on Web is to identify the interactive Web elements and to include eye
      tracking events with the Web technology. The Text 2.0 framework provides a pertinent guideline for the Web
      developers to integrate eye gaze interactions in their Web application. But it does not resolve the problem of
      browsing the current Web with eye-based interactions. For this purpose, users have to rely on gaze emulation of
      mouse and keyboard to operate current desktop browsers, which suﬀers from low usability in the sophisticated
      scenario of Web browsing. Furthermore, there have been some approaches to develop prototypes of gaze-controlled
      Web browsers with very limited functionalities. To the best of our knowledge, there are no available browsers
      providing a wholesome gaze-adapted interface with automatic extraction and handling for complete and smooth Web
      access via gaze commands. In this work, we propose <i>GazeTheWeb</i>, an open source framework to adopt Web
      interfaces
      for gaze interaction, where the input events (which are typically composed of mouse and keyboard interactions in
      generic applications) are revised to eye movements. In comparison to current approaches of additional browser
      extensions to include eye gaze events, we peruse a novel methodology of expending <i>Chromium Embedded
        Framework</i>
      (CEF), which provides more utility and control to build eye controllable interfaces.

      <h3>GAZE THE WEB</h3>
      GazeTheWeb supports unobtrusive gaze-based Web access by a browser incorporating efficient interface
      design and Web engineering. The browser interface is built upon gaze interaction paradigm, i.e., interface
      components such as size, shape, appearance and feedback, which are vital to compensate eye tracking accuracy for
      input control.
      Additionally, the usage frequency of Web navigation (e.g., back, forward, click) has been considered for
      placement and positioning of elements. The Web engineering aspect examines the location of selectable objects on
      webpages, such as text input ﬁelds, hyperlinks, scrollable sections, select ﬁelds, etc. The extracted elements are
      then represented with explicit/implicit indicators to be accessed by eye gaze input. GazeTheWeb browser has been
      released under an open source license, available on GitHub.

    <p>The eye-tracker illuminates the eyes of the user with infrared light and a camera records the eye movements. A
      calibraton provides an estimation of fixations of the user on the screen. We use the fixations for interaction
      with virtual buttions in the graphical interface of GazeTheWeb.

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      GazeTheWeb has been evaluated as part of the MAMEM project at three clinical cohorts in Athens, Thessaloniki and
      Tel
      Aviv, in two trial phases. <br>
      <br>
      At the first trial phase in February 2017, 18 participants with motor impairment succesfully performed dictated
      tasks in the World Wide Web. <br>
      <br>
      <img src="img/phase1.svg" alt="phase1">
      <br>
      <br>
      The second phase has taken place in spring 2018, wheere 30 participants with motor impairment operated
      GazeTheWeb
      for one month a their homes on their own behalf. <br>
      <br>
      The system allowed the particitpants to browse the World Wide Web, perform communication, access entertainment
      and
      retrieve information.<br>
