    <img src="img/placeholder.png" alt="Eye-Tracking visualized">
    <p>The eye-tracker illuminates the eyes of the user with infrared light and a camera records the eye movements. A
      calibraton provides an estimation of fixations of the user on the screen. We use the fixations for interaction
      with virtual buttions in the graphical interface of GazeTheWeb.

    <h2>Does GazeTheWeb work?</h2>
    <p>
      GazeTheWeb has been evaluated as part of the MAMEM project at three clinical cohorts in Athens, Thessaloniki and
      Tel
      Aviv, in two trial phases. <br>
      <br>
      At the first trial phase in February 2017, 18 participants with motor impairment succesfully performed dictated
      tasks in the World Wide Web. <br>
      <br>
      The second phase has taken place in spring 2018, wheere 30 participants with motor impairment operated GazeTheWeb
      for one month a their homes on their own behalf. <br>
      <br>
      The system allowed the particitpants to browse the World Wide Web, perform communication, access entertainment and
      retrieve information.<br>
